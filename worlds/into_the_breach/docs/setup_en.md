# Into the Breach randomizer setup guide

## Required Software
- Archipelago
- Into the Breach
- [ITB ModLoader](https://github.com/itb-community/ITB-ModLoader)
  - [Memedit](https://github.com/itb-community/memedit) must be updated and replace the version found in your modloader at scripts/mod_loader/extensions/modLoaderExtensions/mods. Download the code of the Master branch, NOT from the releases (this is temporary)
  - For convenience, download the [addresses.lua](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1127025077196701828/1128418321730121819/addresses.lua) file, rename it to "__addresses.lua" and replace the file of the same name in the memedit folder you just replaced (this is also temporary)
  - Place the unzipped mod that can be found in the releases of [ITB randomizer for AP](https://github.com/Ishigh1/ITB-randomizer-for-AP) in the mods folder on Into the Breach
